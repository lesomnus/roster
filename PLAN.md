# roster — plan and decision log

roster is the store that answers **who somebody is**: people, the external
identities they sign in with, the addresses they use, and the organisations,
sites and teams they belong to.

It is one layer of an identity system and not the whole of one. The protocol is
Ory Hydra's and the login flow is a Login App's; roster owns the records they
both ask about, and owns `sub`.

It is also the second app payday is tried against, and the more demanding one.

---

## Why it exists, twice

**As a product.** An identity provider can be replaced; the directory behind it
should not have to be. The metadata is ours, the schema is ours, and a customer
IdP's `/userinfo` has only what that customer put in it.

**As a proving ground.** [custody](https://github.com/lesomnus/custody) exercises
payday's domain half — the wall, entities, a public projection. It leaves four
things untouched, and they are roster's whole subject:

| | custody | roster |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the second axis (field 3) | unused | **Site is the isolation boundary** |
| `TokenStore` / `Bearer` | unused | **API keys** |
| `Outbox` / `Drain` | wired, never consumed | **the sync channel** |
| one-to-many edges | none | `Identity`, `Email`, memberships |

### The rule that makes it a proving ground

> **When payday is in the way, stop and fix payday. Do not work around it here.**

roster is a product as well, so the temptation to route around the framework is
real in a way it is not in custody. Every workaround written here is a defect
left in payday for its next user. This is repeated in `CLAUDE.md` because it is
the one rule an agent or a hurried afternoon will break first.

## Where roster sits

                 │                              ║ roster ║  ← owns `sub`
                 │                              ╚═══════╝
                 │                                  ↑  "/api/v1/me"

```

roster is called by machines: the Login App and admin consoles. Not by end
users, and not by browsers. Its own authentication is therefore mTLS or an API
key — **not** `authoidc`, which is for the product apps that consume its
tokens.

### Not roster

Hydra, the Login App, `AuthProvider` implementations (Entra/LDAP/SAML/magic
link), MFA flows, the login UI, the session proxy. Devices, certificate
authorities, ownership transfer — those belong to the product.

---

## Scope

**Phase 1 — the schema.** The irreversible part, and therefore first.

**Phase 2 — whatever payday gets wrong.** Fixed upstream, not here.

**Phase 3 — the app layer.** `/api/v1/me`, the identity-linking rules, a policy
over memberships, credential verification.

**Phase 4 — later.** API keys, the sync channel, the admin console.

---

## Decisions

Recorded as they are made, with the reason, so that a later disagreement argues
with the reason rather than rediscovering the question.

### D1 · `sub` is `Holder.id`

roster owns the identifier the whole system knows a person by. Hydra puts it in
tokens; roster issues it.

The alternative — a provider's own subject as `sub` — makes one person look like
two when they sign in by a second route. That is the thing this design most
wants to avoid.

Consequence: payday's `Holder` **is** the user record. No parallel `users`
table.

### D2 · `Identity` is an entity, not a column on Holder

One person, many external identities: Entra at work and GitHub for the same
human is the stated case. A column is one-to-one and cannot hold it.

The unique key is the pair `(provider, subject)`, and `subject` is whatever that
provider calls immutable — a numeric ID for GitHub, `objectGUID`/`entryUUID`
for LDAP. Never a username and never an email.

### D3 · Email is an entity, and is not unique

Three reasons from the design notes, and they compound:

- an address is not a key: people change them, and organisations reuse them
- verification state has to live somewhere, and `email_verified` decides whether
  an address may be trusted at all
- one person has several

Not unique across the deployment either. A consultant may legitimately be in two
organisations under one address, and a uniqueness constraint would make the
second one an error nobody can resolve. What must be unique is `(holder,
address)` — nobody lists the same address twice.

### D4 · Site is field 3, and only where a row belongs to exactly one

payday reserves field 3 for an edge to a set smaller than a tenant, and Site is
exactly that: the isolation boundary the design names.

But it works only for rows that belong to **one** site. `Team` does. `Holder`
does not — a person can be in several, which is a membership table, so Holder
carries no site edge and is narrowed by tenant alone.

This is a real limit of the second axis rather than a modelling mistake, and it
is written here so the next person does not try to force it.

### D5 · Credential is separate from Holder

The password hash, and later a TOTP secret, are their own row.

Most people have none — they arrive through an external provider — so a column
would be empty on nearly every row. And credentials have a lifetime of their
own: rotation, history, lockout. That is a row that changes when the person does
not.

roster **verifies** rather than handing the hash out. A comparison done
elsewhere is a hash that has left the store, and it puts timing-safe comparison
and lockout in two places.
